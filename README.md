# Cleaner Bot - Hackloop Hackathon

## Introduction

This project is a prototype of an autonomous bot designed to clean campus surroundings. It segregates waste using image classification and uses a robotic hand to pick and drop waste into designated bins. The bot autonomously returns to its charging port after completing its tasks.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation
- Waste segregation using image classification
- Robotic hand for waste collection
- Automatic return to charging port

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Arduino (for robotic hand control)
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
